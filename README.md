# Module 9A - Build Your First React Component

## Description
This is a React app created using Vite that renders a UserProfile component. The component includes a name, bio, and image styled with inline CSS.

## What I Learned
- How to set up a React project using Vite
- How to write and structure a functional React component
- How to use JSX and inline styles
- How to render a component in App.jsx

## Challenges
At first, I tried to access the src folder directly from the Documents directory, which resulted in an error. After creating my UserProfile component, the card appeared aligned to the left instead of centered in the browser. Initially, I thought the issues was with my JSX, but I realised it turned out to be the default CSS in Vite's index.css that constrained the layout, so left it alone. Overall, these challenges helped me understand React project structure, the difference between component-level styles and global CSS, and continuing to use Git commits effectively.
